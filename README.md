# 🛒 ReturnShield AI  
AI-powered, explainable fraud detection dashboard for identifying suspicious return behavior in e-commerce platforms.

---

## 1. Problem Statement  

### Problem Title  
E-commerce Returns Fraud Detection & Explainability System  

### Problem Description  
E-commerce platforms face growing financial losses due to fraudulent return behavior. Common patterns include:

- Serial returners  
- Wardrobing (temporary usage before return)  
- Receipt manipulation  
- Abnormal purchase-return timing  

Manual fraud detection is ineffective due to:

- High transaction volumes  
- Subtle behavioral patterns  
- Evolving fraud strategies  
- Highly imbalanced datasets  

### Target Users
- Fraud Analysts  
- Risk Management Teams  
- E-commerce Operations Teams  
- Product & Policy Teams  

### Existing Gaps
- No structured, explainable fraud detection system  
- Static rule-based detection  
- High false positive rates  
- Lack of behavioral clustering insights  

---

## 2. Problem Understanding & Approach  

### Root Cause Analysis
- Fraud patterns evolve over time  
- Rule-based systems fail against adaptive fraud  
- Imbalanced datasets make detection difficult  
- Lack of interpretability in existing systems  

### Solution Strategy
We propose an AI-driven anomaly detection dashboard that:

- Detects suspicious behavioral patterns  
- Assigns interpretable risk scores  
- Identifies fraud clusters  
- Provides explanation for flagged users  

---

## 3. Proposed Solution  

### Solution Overview
An end-to-end Returns Fraud Detection Dashboard that:

- Ingests transaction logs  
- Engineers behavioral features  
- Applies anomaly detection  
- Assigns explainable risk scores  
- Visualizes fraud insights  

### Core Idea
Combine anomaly detection + behavioral analytics + explainable AI.

### Key Features
- Serial return detection  
- Wardrobing behavior analysis  
- Purchase-return timing anomaly detection  
- Receipt manipulation flagging  
- Risk scoring engine  
- Interactive fraud dashboard
